# Hello, I'm ssdelay ðŸ‘‹  ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=ssdelay)

Graduated with a technical degree, where I honed my ability to transform abstract concepts into functional systems. My toolkit spans across layersâ€”from crafting responsive interfaces to engineering robust backends and orchestrating containerized environments.

Backend Alchemy
- Sculpted applications with C#, from WinForms to modern WPF (including WPF UI), and built scalable APIs with ASP.NET Core
- Designed and containerized microservices, leveraging Docker
- Explored Pythonâ€™s ecosystem with FastAPI and Django
- Architected RESTful endpoints, managed data flows, and optimized queries across PostgreSQL and MySQL

Frontend Artistry
- Shaped dynamic UIs with Vue and Nuxt, blending TypeScript with Tailwind
- Navigated the full stack, occasionally diving into PHP for legacy systems

Mobile & Beyond
- Experimented with Kotlin to build lightweight Android applications
- Tinkered with PyQt5 for cross-platform desktop solutions
